## Starting Point

The application had the following routes as the starting point:

- GET /
  - GET /api
    - GET /api/users
    - POST /api/users
      - GET /api/users/:id
      - PATCH /api/users/:id
      - DELETE /api/users/:id
    - GET /api/posts
    - POST /api/posts
      - GET /api/posts/:id
      - PATCH /api/posts/:id
      - DELETE /api/posts/:id

## Added Additional Routes

Created the following routes, using good organizational and coding practices:

- GET /api/users/:id/posts
  - Retrieves all posts by a user with the specified id.
- GET /api/posts?userId=value
  - Retrieves all posts by a user with the specified postId.
- GET /comments
  - Note that we do not have any comments data yet; that is okay! Make sure that you create a place to store comments, but you do not need to populate that data.
- POST /comments
  - When creating a new comment object, it should have the following fields:
    - id: a unique identifier.
    - userId: the id of the user that created the comment.
    - postId: the id of the post the comment was made on.
    - body: the text of the comment.
- GET /comments/:id
  - Retrieves the comment with the specified id.
- PATCH /comments/:id
  - Used to update a comment with the specified id with a new body.
